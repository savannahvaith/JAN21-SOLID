# SOLID Principles

Each of the 5 solid principles are stored within their own package:

* Single Responsibility Principle: `solid.srp/`
* Open/Closed Principle: `solid.ocpenclosed/`
* Liskov Subsititution Principle: `solid.liskov/`
* Interface Segregation Principle: `solid.interfaceseg/`
* Dependency Inversion Principle: `solid.depinv/`


High Level Overview: 

Single Responsibility - the notion that one class has one responsibility!
Open closed - Open for extension, closed for modification!
Liskov Substituion - Base and Derived classes should be able to be swapped without knowing it
Interface Segregation - Code shouldn't be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use.
Dependency Inversion - High level objects shouldn't depend on low level objects, but should use abstractions.
